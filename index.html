      <h1>EverFit</h1>
      <p>
        An accessible fitness and physical therapy app designed to support elderly users through intuitive design and motivational tools.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      EverFit addresses the growing need for accessible fitness tools for aging populations.
      Many elderly individuals struggle with mobility and motivation, especially when using
      apps not built with their needs in mind. Our app bridges this gap with simple navigation,
      guided workouts, and a friendly assistant.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Improve mobility, provide motivation, and reduce injury risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Target Users:</strong> Elderly individuals with limited tech experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Features:</strong> Exercise tracking, assistant chat, progress visualizations, and more.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Design Process -->
  <section id="design">
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>We followed a human-centered design process, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User interviews and surveys to understand elderly needs and pain points.</li>
      <li>Personas representing different levels of tech familiarity and mobility.</li>
      <li>User journey maps and storyboards outlining common app interactions.</li>
      <li>Multiple rounds of design iterations based on user feedback and heuristic evaluations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Prototyping -->
  <section id="prototype">
    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <p>We created a high-fidelity prototype in Figma to demonstrate all core user flows, from tracking workouts to receiving assistance and viewing progress.</p>
  
    <div class="prototype-gallery">
      <img src="images/landing-page.png" alt="Landing Page" />
      <img src="images/workout-tracker.png" alt="Workout Tracker" />
      <img src="images/chat-assistant.png" alt="Chat Assistant" />
      <img src="images/workout-history.png" alt="Workout History" />
      <img src="images/progress-tracker.png" alt="Progress Tracker" />
      <img src="images/help-page.png" alt="Help Page" />
      <img src="images/questionaire.png" alt="Questionaire" />
    </div>
  
    <p>These screens were reviewed by peers and older adults, and their feedback helped refine text size, layout simplicity, and feature prioritization.</p>
  </section>
  

  <!-- Heuristic Evaluation -->
  <section id="heuristics">
    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visibility of System Status:</strong> Progress bars and simple visual feedback improve user confidence.</li>
      <li><strong>Recognition Over Recall:</strong> Large icons and persistent navigation elements support memory constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Prevention:</strong> Confirmations for risky actions (like resetting data) were added based on feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Suggested Improvements:</strong> Increased contrast, simplified menu labels, and larger tap targets.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Reflections -->
  <section id="reflections">
    <h2>Reflections & Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      EverFit reinforced the importance of empathy in the design process. By centering the needs of elderly users,
      we built something simple, functional, and motivating. Key lessons included the value of early user feedback,
      the power of visual hierarchy, and how thoughtful details (like language and layout) can make technology feel more human.
    </p>
    <p>We're proud of how this prototype responds to real-world accessibility needs and hope to see similar principles adopted more widely.</p>
